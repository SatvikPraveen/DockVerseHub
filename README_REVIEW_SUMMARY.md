## 💡 Implementation Recommendation

### Recommended Approach: **Strategy A - Full Enhancement**

**Why**: Current project is already excellent foundation. Small additions make it industry-leading.

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks, 48 total hours

**Week 1**: Phase 1 (Immediate fixes)
- Fixes all README inconsistencies
- Provides clear onboarding
- 9 hours, very high impact

**Week 2**: Phase 2 (K8s + GitOps)
- Makes platform relevant to modern DevOps
- Covers full container ecosystem
- 14 hours, very high impact

**Week 3**: Phase 3 (Advanced features)
